Authenticating is done with an authentication token in the X-Auth-Token header.\n\n```\ncurl -H 'X-Auth-Token: my_authentication_token'\n```\n\nAuthentication tokens are used to identify the user your application is connecting to the API on behalf of. Think of authentication tokens as permanent sessionsâ€”the user creates authentication tokens, and your app can use them to connect to the API on their behalf until they delete the token.\n\n"
